mainmenu
========
Simple module written on C with curses for small terminal games

Build test program
./build.sh install
./test

Test russian language
LANGUAGE=ru ./test

How to use it

Get mainmenu.c and mainmenu.h from src directory.
Move it in your project.

In your main c file include <curses.h> and
 if you want to use another language <locale.h> with <libintl.h>
After that include "mainmenu.h"

Now, make some global variables:

Program name
const char  pn[]             = gettext_noop("Test");

Name for config file
Every param will be saved in home directory of user so this file should have name starting
 with '.'.
const char  fn[]             = ".testcfg";

Text for mainmenu
You must have at least 3 texts. Last`ll use for exit, last but one for settings
const char  mt[][mm_bufsize] = { 
				 gettext_noop("Play game"),
                                 gettext_noop("Button"),
                                 gettext_noop("Button"),
                                 gettext_noop("Button"),
                                 gettext_noop("Button"),
                                 gettext_noop("Button"),
                                 gettext_noop("Settings"),
                                 gettext_noop("Exit")
};

Text for settings
const char  st[][mm_bufsize] = { 
				 gettext_noop("Speed"),
                                 gettext_noop("Strength"),
                                 gettext_noop("Distance"),
                                 gettext_noop("Luck"),
                                 gettext_noop("Mana"),
                                 gettext_noop("Xp"),
                                 gettext_noop("Gold")
};

Here your values.
First  - is it float or integer
Second - default value
Third  - difference between increasing/decreasing
Fourth - minimal value
Fifth  - max value
const char  sr[][mm_bufsize] = { 
				 "f", "0.25", "0.25", "0", "1",
                                 "i", "25", "1", "0", "50",
                                 "i", "25", "1", "0", "50",
                                 "i", "25", "1", "0", "50",
                                 "i", "25", "1", "0", "50",
                                 "i", "25", "1", "0", "50",
                                 "i", "25", "1", "0", "50"
};

Pointers on your variables (they can be static global variables)
      void *sp[]             = { 
				 &speed, &strength, &distance, &luck,
                                 &mana, &xp, &gold
};

Count of tabs/params in mainmenu/settings
const int   mc = 8, sc = 7;

Colors in program
Background color, font color, attributes
First  row - program name
Second row - default text
Third  row - cursor
Fourth row - highlighted param
const int   mm_colors[mm_colors_count] = {
                                 COLOR_WHITE, COLOR_BLACK, A_STANDOUT,
                                 COLOR_WHITE, COLOR_BLACK, 0,
                                 COLOR_RED, COLOR_BLACK, A_BOLD,
                                 COLOR_RED, COLOR_BLACK, 0
};

Also, you should have function to init your curses settings again because
 mainmenu using their settings.
Before endless loop you have to initscr().

Your loop may look like this:
        for (;;) {
                res = mainmenu();
                initcurses();
		if (!res)
			playgame();
                if (res == exit_choise)
                        break;
        }
exit_choise is in mainmenu.h like mm_bufsize and mm_colors_count.
mainmenu() return index of text that someone choosed:
if someone choosed Play game (first text in mainmenu) then mainmenu() will return 0.

Don`t forget to endwin() after all.

If you are using another language in your menu then
 compile mainmenu.c with -lncursesw library
